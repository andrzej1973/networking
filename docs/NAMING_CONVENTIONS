Naming conventions used in this program

    - Trivial Variables: i,n,c,etc... (Only one letter. If one letter isn't clear, then make it a Local Variable)
    - Local Variables: lowerCamelCase
    - Global Variables: g_lowerCamelCase
    - Const Variables: ALL_CAPS
    - Pointer Variables: add a p_ to the prefix. For global variables it would be gp_var, for local variables p_var, for const variables p_VAR. If far pointers are used then use an fp_ instead of p_.
    - Structs: ModuleCamelCase (Module = full module name, or a 2-3 letter abbreviation, but still in CamelCase.)
    - Struct Member Variables: lowerCamelCase
    - Enums: ModuleCamelCase
    - Enum Values: ALL_CAPS
    - Public Functions: ModuleCamelCase
    - Private Functions: CamelCase
    - Macros: CamelCase
